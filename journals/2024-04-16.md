1. What did you do to work on your project?
	- Over the past week, I have been coding and testing
2. What specific things did you accomplish?
	- I finished writing [the schematic assembler](https://github.com/kwzuu/minecraft_computer/tree/main/schematic_assembler)
	- I started on [the codegen](https://github.com/kwzuu/minecraft_computer/tree/main/codegen)
	- I started implementing some behaviours of the computer (notably, [memory accesses](https://github.com/kwzuu/minecraft_computer/blob/99b3e866450c33dd606186da166ffc7a5212723d/codegen/generate_computer.py#L39))
	- I made [a fork](https://github.com/kwzuu/quartz_nbt/tree/master) of [the nbt library](https://crates.io/crates/quartz_nbt)
	- I thought quite a bit about the architecture of the computer
1. What are some challenges you faced as you worked on this project?
	- I realised that there was a missing feature in the nbt library I was using, so I had to make a fork of it and add some changes. 
2. As of today's date, how many hours have you put into your capstone?
	- 12 Hours
3. Reflect on, and describe how someone in your support group assisted you with your project.
	- I was talking with my dad about architectural decisions, and he helped to clarify my mental image of what I was doing.
