1. What did you do to work on your project?
   - I worked on the documentation for my tooling
   - I tested some stuff
   - I fixed some bugs
2. What specific things did you accomplish?
   - I wrote [an integration test for indirection](https://github.com/kwzuu/minecraft_computer/blob/main/computer/integration_tests/four_function.py)
   - I fixed indirection not working
   - I fixed there being a weird offset on command block chains that only have chain command blocks
   - I documented the fuck <!-- TODO: remove humour before handing in !!!!!! -->
3. What are some challenges you faced as you worked on this project?
   - There was a somewhat-elusive bug pertaining to inheritance, basically
   [RelativeCoordinates](https://github.com/kwzuu/minecraft_computer/blob/b34005faa373474a5535090445e2e7036a0ecdf5/computer/codegen/coordinates.py#L54)
   inherited [Coordinates](https://github.com/kwzuu/minecraft_computer/blob/b34005faa373474a5535090445e2e7036a0ecdf5/computer/codegen/coordinates.py#L5)
   but didn't override some behaviour that it needed to. Conclusion is that inheritance is bad and you shouldn't use it.
4. As of today's date, how many hours have you put into your capstone?
   - 30-40
5. Reflect on, and describe how someone in your support group assisted you with your project.
   - My dad and I were chatting about how I could implement devices, specifically the [terminal emulator](https://github.com/kwzuu/minecraft_computer/blob/main/journals/Character%20Device.md)
